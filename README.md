# iStruct2D-Python

The iStruct2D is my individual project, the purpose of the project is to develop a prototype of the structural analysis software by using Python, 
this software is using Direct Stiffness Method to solve the bending moment diagram, shear force diagram, deflection and reaction force for a user-input structure, 
then representing the result in a comprehensive user interface.


## Usage

Similar to the traditional structural analysis software, the analysis results from iStruct2D can be implemented in the structural engineering discipline.
